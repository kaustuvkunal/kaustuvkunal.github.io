## Abstract

Serverless architectures are cost effective, fast, reliable and less maintainable. Building such systems for big data setup is challenging task specially, for start-ups. The paper proposes a baseline serverless large scale end-to-end batch log processing architecture for data analytics and modeling followed by its case study. The four-layer FaaS architecture is effective, low maintainable, inexpensive and shall be setup leveraging any public cloud. In addition to typical serverless advantages, it also aids in data management and user profiling.
