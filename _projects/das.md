Data Automation system

## DAS (Data Automation system)

Data Automation System is a resilient, autoscaling, near real-time Big Data processing automation systems based on Hadoop, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, CloudBreak, Cascading and Java. DAS systems process thousands of campaignâ€™s events & clicks data at the scale of Petabytes per day. We have used Hadoop MapReduce, Avro and Cascading modules for processing impression, click and event data.
